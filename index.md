## Public molecular dynamics data for the P.1 strain in the ACE2-RBD interaction (PDB ID: 6M0J)

The methodology used was based on the NAMD3 algorithm with GPU acceleration. Explicit solvation of TIP3P water molecules was considered and the system was neutralized by inserting Na + and Cl- at a concentration of 0.15M. The simulations have an estimated duration of 12 ns with the integration time of 2fs. So many simulations containing the 3 (three) mutations (N501Y, E484K and K417T) are available that affected the RBD region of the Spike protein as well as the wild-type structure.
